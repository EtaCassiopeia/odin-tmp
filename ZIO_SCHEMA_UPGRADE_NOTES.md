# ZIO Schema Upgrade Notes

## Overview

Successfully upgraded ZIO Schema from version 0.4.17 to 1.7.5, including all related dependencies.

## Version Updates

### Before:
```scala
"dev.zio" %% "zio-schema" % "0.4.17"
"dev.zio" %% "zio-schema-avro" % "0.4.17" 
"dev.zio" %% "zio-schema-json" % "0.4.17"
"dev.zio" %% "zio-json" % "0.6.2"
```

### After:
```scala
val ZioSchemaVersion = "1.7.5"
val ZioJsonVersion = "0.7.3"  // Compatible with zio-schema 1.7.5

"dev.zio" %% "zio-schema" % ZioSchemaVersion
"dev.zio" %% "zio-schema-avro" % ZioSchemaVersion 
"dev.zio" %% "zio-schema-json" % ZioSchemaVersion
"dev.zio" %% "zio-json" % ZioJsonVersion
```

## Breaking Changes Fixed

### 1. Avro Schema toString() Method
**Issue**: `avroSchema.toString(true)` was deprecated.
**Fix**: Changed to `avroSchema.toString()` (without the boolean parameter).

**Files updated**:
- `core/src/main/scala/compat/schema/core/manifest.scala`
- `core/src/main/scala/compat/schema/core/autoDerivation.scala`

### 2. ZIO JSON Version Compatibility
**Issue**: ZIO Schema 1.7.5 requires ZIO JSON 0.7.x, not 0.6.x.
**Fix**: Updated ZIO JSON from 0.6.2 to 0.7.3.

## Core API Changes

The good news is that most of the ZIO Schema core API remained stable:

- ✅ `Schema[T]` - No changes needed
- ✅ `DeriveSchema.gen[T]` - Still works as expected
- ✅ `zio.schema.codec.AvroSchemaCodec.encode()` - Still works
- ✅ Core schema derivation macros - Compatible

## Testing Results

- ✅ All modules compile successfully (core + compat-plugin)
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Both Scala 3.3.3 (core) and Scala 2.12.18 (compat-plugin) work correctly
- ✅ No runtime issues detected

## Migration Impact

This was a relatively smooth upgrade because:
1. The project was already using modern ZIO Schema APIs (`DeriveSchema.gen`)
2. No deprecated schema builders were in use
3. Only surface-level API changes needed fixing

## Recommendations

1. **Pin dependency versions**: The new build.sbt uses constants for better dependency management
2. **Monitor for updates**: ZIO Schema is actively developed, check for newer versions regularly
3. **Test thoroughly**: While this upgrade went smoothly, always run comprehensive tests after major version upgrades

## Next Steps

Consider upgrading other dependencies if needed:
- ScalaTest is at 3.2.17 (current is 3.2.18+)
- Refined is at 0.11.0 (current is 0.11.2+)
- Apache Avro is at 1.11.3 (current is 1.12.x)

However, these are optional and not urgent.
